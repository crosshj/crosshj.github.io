	`Hello. I’m <span class="highlight">Harrison Cross</span>, a
  software developer with over a decade of professional
  experience building and maintaining everything from
  small projects to complex systems across industries like
  HR, finance, automotive, and more.`,
	`Whether it’s tackling legacy systems or working with the
  latest tech, I’m driven by the challenge of creating
  solutions that get the job done. I’ve worked on a wide
  range of projects using React, Node.js, AWS, and more,
  but it’s not just about the tools — it’s about solving
  real problems in a way that makes a difference for both
  users and businesses.`,
	`I’m also big on sharing what I’ve learned along the way.
  Leading teams isn’t just about giving direction — it’s
  about lifting others up, and that’s something I focus on
  daily. From mentoring junior developers to driving
  forward projects that push the envelope, I’m always
  looking for ways to help the people I work with grow and
  succeed.`,
	`When I’m not coding at work, you can find me coding on
  side projects, making music, drawing, animating, or 3D
  printing. I’m always up for a new challenge, so if you
  have a project you’d like to discuss or just want to
  chat, feel free to reach out.`,
