						Hello. I’m
						<span class="highlight">Harrison Cross</span>, a
						software developer with over a decade of professional
						experience building and maintaining everything from
						small projects to complex systems across industries like
						HR, finance, automotive, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether it’s tackling legacy systems or working with the
						latest tech, I’m driven by the challenge of creating
						solutions that get the job done. I’ve worked on a wide
						range of projects using React, Node.js, AWS, and more,
						but it’s not just about the tools — it’s about solving
						real problems in a way that makes a difference for both
						users and businesses.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’m also big on sharing what I’ve learned along the way.
						Leading teams isn’t just about giving direction — it’s
						about lifting others up, and that’s something I focus on
						daily. From mentoring junior developers to driving
						forward projects that push the envelope, I’m always
						looking for ways to help the people I work with grow and
						succeed.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I’m not coding at work, you can find me coding on
						side projects, making music, drawing, animating, or 3D
						printing. I’m always up for a new challenge, so if you
						have a project you’d like to discuss or just want to
						chat, feel free to reach out.
					</p>
